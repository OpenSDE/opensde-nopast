OpenSDE - Open System Development Environment.
http://opensde.org/

In 1998 Clifford Wolf created ROCK Linux [1], a great shell-based
'Distribution Build Kit' to help system administrators create and
maintain their own Linux distributions.

In 2004, Ren√© Rebe made his second (the first was named dROCK) fork
due to an (in the view of some developers) inconvenient development
cycle [2]. This fork with the temporary code name 'T2' [3] finally
turned into the T2-Project [4]. The goal of T2 was to decentralize the
development and revive the almost stalled ROCK-Linux development.
It reworked the 'Distribution Build Kit' into 'System Development
Environment' (SDE) to decouple it from the 'Distribution' concept
which is strongly linked to the Linux Kernel.

In May 2006 OpenSDE [5] was born, aimed at the reimplementation of the
build engine which should result in a more efficient and flexible
framework and lower the entry level for users as well as
developers. OpenSDE, then two months later, after personal and many
technical differences, was detached into its own project by
Alejandro Mery, supported by T2 as well as former ROCK-Linux
developers.

The SDE concept is intended as an open framework to build an operating
system (not necessarily restricted to GNU/Linux) enabling the creation
of systems for diverse architectures with various boot options and a
tailored software selection.

OpenSDE has now turned into an ambitious purely team-lead project
where decisions are made based on their technical merit uninfluenced
by its predecessors and contribution are judged by their quality and
security.

    brand recognition reasons.
