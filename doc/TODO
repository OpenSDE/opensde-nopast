	- package amarok needs ruby to build, if there is no ruby it will only build the docs and the .po files
	  on the amarok.cache there is no [DEP] ruby, and this is not present in the cache file after a
	  successful build either.
	- fix Build-Target to keep a log of the 'output' at build_target.log again.
	- enable (optionally) fortran compiler support on gcc

Second Generation: re-design/re-implement
	- Change the backend to something client/server with a modular
	  and eficient engine. (Wishlist: C core, domain sockets, library for
	  sh scripts, lua modules, bootstrapping)

Third Generation: new features
	- package branches (more than one .desc per package)
	- package attributes (build options)
	- package splits (more than one result package per package)
	- language preselection
