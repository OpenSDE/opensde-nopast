target, tgt
.RS 4
Synchronizes the specified target to the latest changes in the upstream repository, but only if it originally came from a repository. If the specified target does not originally come from a repository this command will result in an error message.
.RE
When no discriminator is specified, then the default discriminator depends on the current working directory. When the current working direcotry is inside one of the targets, then that target will get synchronized. on the other hand if it is inside the package tree, then the package tree will get synchronized. If neither of these is the case, then the OpenSDE system will get synchronized.
