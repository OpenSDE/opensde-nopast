NAME
----
*sde-sync* - synchronizes all or part of the system with upstream changes.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'sde sync' ['DISCRIMINATOR'] ['OPTIONS'] ['ITEMS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Synchronizes part of the environment to the latest version from the 
repository. Depending on the discriminator specified either the package
tree, an identified target, the OpenSDE framework or all of then will 
get synchronized with upstream changes.

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------
*all*::
	Synchronizes everything (system, packages and targets) to the 
	latest changes in the upstream repository. However, only items 
	that actually came from a repository will get synchronized. Other
	items will not be touched.
	This discriminator does not require any items to be specified.
*package, pkg*::
	Synchronizes the package tree to the latest changes in the upstream
	repository.
	This discriminator does not require any items to be specified.
*system, sys*::
	Synchronizes the OpenSDE framework to the latest changes in the 
	upstream repository.
	This discriminator does not require any items to be specified.
*target, tgt*::
	Synchronizes the specified target to the latest changes in the 
	upstream repository, but only if it originally came from a 
	repository. If the specified target does not originally come from 
	a repository this command will result in an error message.

When no discriminator is specified, then the default discriminator depends
on the current working directory. When the current working direcotry is 
inside one of the targets, then that target will get synchronized. on the 
other hand if it is inside the package tree, then the package tree will get 
synchronized. If neither of these is the case, then the OpenSDE system will 
get synchronized.

OPTIONS
