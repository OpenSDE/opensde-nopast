NAME
----
sde - front end wrapper

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sde* ['COMMAND'] ['DISCRIMINATOR'] ['OPTIONS'] ['ITEMS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *sde* frontend wrapper is a single command to access all OpenSDE
functionality. It is a wrapper since it wraps all existing commands in
a single interface. Beyond this simple wrapping the command makes it 
also possible to work with separate sde environments. For this the 
environment variable *SDEROOT* is used.

COMMANDS
--------
Various commands are available, each one targeting a special 
operation. Amongst these commands are:

	build    - building packages
	clean    - cleaning part of your environment
	config   - configuring part of your environment
	create   - creating new packages or target
	download - downloading packages
	install  - installing sde or packages on your current system
	update   - updating packages

For a complete list of commands execute the following command:
	sde help

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------
OpenSDE supports various discriminators, however what discriminators 
are valid depends on the command being used.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*SDEROOT*::
	When *SDEROOT* is set, sde uses it as the path to your
	sde environment. If not specified the current working
	directory is used.
