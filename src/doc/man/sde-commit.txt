NAME
----
sde-commit - Commit changes

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sde commit* ['DISCRIMINATOR'] ['OPTIONS'] ['ITEMS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Commits changes to the identified part (item) within the sde environment
section indicated by the discriminator. When the user has commit rights 
to the SCM repository containing the item, using this command will indeed 
commit the changes. If there are no commit rights to the repository, all 
changes will be wrapped up in a patch and send to the mailing list.  

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------
*package, pkg*::
	Commits changes to the specified packages (items).
*repository, repo*::
	Commits all modified pkgs in the specified repositories (items).
*system, sys*::
	Commits all changes to the sde framework itself. For this 
	discriminator no items should be provided.
*target, tgt*::
	Commits all changes to the specified targets (items).

When no discriminator is specified, this command will default to the closest
discriminator in regard to the current working directory.
