NAME
----
sde-export - Export stuff out of the system

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sde export* ['DISCRIMINATOR'] ['OPTIONS'] ['ITEM'] filename

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Exports part of the sde system specified by item. All information belonging to
the specified item will be wrapped up in a single bundle and written to the
specified file. This file can be imported (*sde import*) again later or on a 
different host elsewhere. This command is ideal for sending information to the 
opensde mailing list or sharing uncommitted changes with co-workers.

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------
*config, cfg*::
	Wraps up the config specified by item and writes it to the specified 
	file. Besides the config information, also information about the
	host system is included. This is needed to detect difference between
	the current host and the target system where the exported results will
	be imported.
*package, pkg*::
	Wraps up the package specified by item and writes it to the specified 
	file. Besides the package content, also the fully qualified package
	name will be stored. This is needed to be able to recreate the 
	package at the exact same location on import.
*target, tgt*::
	Wraps up the target specified by item and writes it to the specified 
	file.

OPTIONS FOR ALL DISCRIMINATORS
------------------------------
*-f, --force*::
	Makes it possible to overwrite existing files. Normal processing
	will abort when the given file already exists.
*-q, --quiet*::
	Reduces the verbosity level.
*-v, --verbose*::
	Increases the verbosity level.

OPTIONS FOR PACKAGE AND TARGET DISCRIMINATORS
---------------------------------------------
*-d, --diff*::
	Only wraps up changes to reduce filesize.
