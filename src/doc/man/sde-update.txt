NAME
----
sde-update - updates all or part of the system with upstream changes.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'sde update' [DISCRIMINATORS] [OPTIONS] [ITEMS...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Updates part of the environment to the latest version from the 
repository. Depending on the discriminator specified either the package
tree, an identified target, the OpenSDE framework or all of then will 
get updated

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------

all::
	Update everything (system, packages and targets) to the latest
	state from the repository. However, only items that came from
	a repository will be updated to the latest version of that
	repository. Other items will not be touched.
	This discriminator does not require any items to be specified.

package, pkg::
	Updates the package tree to the latest state of the repository.
	This discriminator does not require any items to be specified.

system, sys::
	Updates the OpenSDE framework to the latest state of the
	repository.
	This discriminator does not require any items to be specified.

target, tgt::
	Updates the specified target to the latest state from its
	repository, but only if it comes from a repository. If the
	specified target does not come from a repository this command
	will result in an error message.

When no discriminator is specified, then the default discriminator depends
on the current working directory. When the current working direcotry is 
inside one of the targets, then that target will be updated. On the other 
hand if it is inside the package tree, then the package tree will get updated.
If neither of these is the case, then the OpenSDE system will get updated.

OPTIONS
-------

-v, --verbose::
	Give additional feedback on what is happening.
