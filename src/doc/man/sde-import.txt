NAME
----
sde import - import stuff into the system

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sde import* ['DISCRIMINATOR'] ['OPTIONS'] ['ITEM'] filename

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Imports the specified filename into the opensde environment under the name
specified by item. If no item name is specified the original name as stored 
in the imported file will be used. The content of the specified file needs to
match the kind of content specified by the discriminator. In case the content
does not match the command will abort with an error message.

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------
*config, cfg*::
	Forces the imported file to be a config.
*package, pkg*::
	Forces the imported file to be a package.
*target, tgt*::
	Forces the imported file to be a target.

When no discriminator specified the imported file will be processed without
checking against a discriminator.

OPTIONS FOR ALL DISCRIMINATORS
------------------------------
*-f, --force*::
	Makes it possible to overwrite existing items with imported 
	information.
*-n, --dry-run*::
	Instead of really importing the file it is normally processed but
	not imported. This can be used to see what would happen if the
	file were imported.
*-q, --quiet*::
	Reduces the verbosity level.
*-v, --verbose*::
	Increases the verbosity level.
