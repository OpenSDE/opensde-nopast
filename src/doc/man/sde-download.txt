SYNOPSIS
--------
*sde download* ['DISCRIMINATOR'] ['OPTIONS'] ['ITEMS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
sde-download downloads one or more packages indicated by or belonging to the
specified items. Multiple items can be specified.

DISCRIMINATORS
--------------
*config, cfg*::
	Downloads all selected packages in the specified config (item).
*package, pkg*::
	Downloads single packages specified by item.
*repository, repo*::
	Downloads all packages in the repositories specified by item.

When no discriminitor is given on the command line the current working 
directory will be used to determine the discriminator. If still no 
discriminator can be determined, the *package* discriminator will be used.

OPTIONS FOR ALL DISCRIMINATORS
------------------------------
*-q, --quiet*::
	Reduces feedback to an absolute minimum.
*-v, --verbose*::
	Gives additional feedback.
*-n, --dry-run*::
	Process normally, but instead of downloading missing files a message
	will be written to the terminal for every missing file.
*--timeout none|normal|long*::
	Defines how tolerat to download delay are we. The default value
	is *normal*. Other values are *none* for no timeout at all and 
	*long* for a longer than normal timeout.
*--check never|download|always*::
	Defines when downloads should be checked against the checksum in
	package *.desc* files. By default checksums will *always* checked.
	Other possible values are *never* to disable checksum verification
